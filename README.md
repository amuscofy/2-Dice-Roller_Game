# 2-Dice-Roller_Game
2 Dice Roller

This is a dice roller application that was modified from the training received from Google. In it, you'll find an additional dice included that gives the feel of two dice being rolled. The game encourages the player to roll the dice 10 times from which successive results are added together. If the total sum after the rolling for 10 consecutive times is equal to or above the target, then the player wins. If not, the player is encouraged to try again.

The Challenge: While I have been able to create the dice roll countdown from ten to zero, At the moment I have not been able to get the successive addition done successfully. hence the game has not been fully implemented. I am new to kotlin and android app development and I believe I am getting too much ahead of myself.

My Thoughts: My desire is to get this game finished and to add some more functionality to it. Once I get the addition of the successive dice roll sorted, I'll be adding a switch to it that will implement an easy and hard mode, which players can choose from. I'll also be adding a display showing "Congratulation you won" at the middle of the 2 dice as well as win cups üèÜ at both sides of the text.
